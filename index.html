      <h1>Change your heart, not your body.</h1>
         <p>Here's the truth: having a perfect body isn't your purpose. But have you found yourself obsessing over it anyways?</p>
         <p>Have you found yourself adopting diet after diet, searching for a sense of fulfillment?</p>
         <p>I get it. I spent years of my life scrambling everywhere for the answers I was looking for. I listened to podcasts, hired gurus, read books, I moved states, I bought a puppy and I continued to try just about everything I could think of.
           <p>While all of these mechanisms are wonderful, they still can't even scrape the surface of what <em>real</em> healing can provide for you.</p>
           <p>You see, I used to be a fitness competitor who was obsessed with <strong>clean eating, counting macros, and working out twice a day</strong>. I <em>know</em> what it's like to find yourself in the throes of orthorexia, where your body and food becomes the number one priority in your life.</p>
           <img style= "height: 450px; width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0 auto; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;" src="http://maddymoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_9195.jpg"/>
           <p>After practicing self-care rituals day after day, I realized something else was <strong>missing</strong> from my life. Something <strong>bigger</strong> than anything I had been doing.</p>
           <p>Everyone kept telling me to <em>search</em> within to find all of the answers. But I found the <em>more</em> I searched within, the <em>less</em> I found what I really needed.</p>
      <h1>...until I realized it was God that was missing from my "healing" process.</h2>
      <img style="height: 450px; width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0 auto; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888" src="http://maddymoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/journaling.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div class="centered-block">
      <p><strong>From that day on, I started praying daily that God would change my heart.</strong> I didn't pray that I would change my <em>own</em> heart, because I knew <em>that</em> wasn't going to happen. Only He could do it because only He could fill the empty space in my heart that I was trying to fill with food, perfectionism and my body image.</p>
      <ul class="cross">
        <li>Do want to ask Christ to provide the kind of healing that ends with you spending more time thinking about things you're passionate about than you do about your next meal?</li>
        <li>Do you want to feast on the bread of life instead of your never-satisfying gluten-free, low calorie, non-GMO, "clean" eating snacks? </li>
        <li>Do you want God to give you the courage you need to delete your calorie counting app and burn up your meal plan for good?</li>
        <li>Are you fed up with obsessing over having the perfect diet and perfect body?</li>
        <li>Do you want to be the "salt of the earth" but can't get past your literal <em>fear</em> of eating salt in your diet?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="top-margin">If you answered yes to any of these, the <em>big</em> question remains. How do we let go of our need to control, and give it over to God? How do we get to a place where food is just food, and it's no longer what we obsess about?</p>

      <h1>Change your heart, not your diet.</h1>
         <p>Here's the truth: having a perfect body isn't your purpose. But have you found yourself obsessing over it anyways?</p>
         <p>Have you found yourself adopting diet after diet, searching for a sense of fulfillment?</p>
         <p>I get it. I spent years of my life scrambling everywhere for the answers I was looking for. I listened to podcasts, hired gurus, read books, I moved states, I bought a puppy and I continued to try just about everything I could think of.
           <p>While all of these mechanisms are wonderful, they still can't even scrape the surface of what <em>real</em> healing can provide for you.</p>
           <p>You see, I used to be a fitness competitor who was obsessed with <strong>clean eating, counting macros, and working out twice a day</strong>. I <em>know</em> what it's like to find yourself in the throes of orthorexia, where your body and food becomes the number one priority in your life.</p>
           <img style= "height: 450px; width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0 auto; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;" src="http://maddymoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_9195.jpg"/>
           <p>After practicing self-care rituals day after day, I realized something else was <strong>missing</strong> from my life. Something <strong>bigger</strong> than anything I had been doing.</p>
           <p>Everyone kept telling me to <em>search</em> within to find all of the answers. But I found the <em>more</em> I searched within, the <em>less</em> I found what I really needed.</p>
      <h2>...until I realized it was <span class="circled">God</span> that was missing from my "healing" process.</h2>
      <img style="height: 450px; width: 300px; display: block; margin: 10px auto 50px auto; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888" src="http://maddymoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/journaling.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div class="centered-block">
      <p><strong>From that day on, I started praying daily that God would change my heart.</strong> I didn't pray that I would change my <em>own</em> heart, because I knew <em>that</em> wasn't going to happen. Only He could do it because only He could fill the empty space in my heart that I was trying to fill with food, perfectionism and my body image.</p>
      <ul class="cross">
        <li>Do you want to ask Christ to provide the kind of healing that ends with you spending more time thinking about things you're passionate about than you do about your next meal?</li>
        <li>Do you want to feast on the bread of life instead of your never-satisfying gluten-free, low calorie, non-GMO, "clean" eating snacks? </li>
        <li>Do you want God to give you the courage you need to delete your calorie counting app and burn up your meal plan for good?</li>
        <li>Are you fed up with obsessing over having the perfect diet and perfect body?</li>
        <li>Do you want to be the "salt of the earth" but can't get past your literal <em>fear</em> of eating salt in your diet?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="top-margin">If you answered yes to any of these, the <em>big</em> question remains. How do we let go of our need to control, and give it over to God? How do we get to a place where food is just food, and it's no longer what we obsess about?</p>

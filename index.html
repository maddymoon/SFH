      <h1>Change your heart, not your diet.</h1>
         <p>Here's the truth: having a perfect body isn't your purpose. But have you found yourself obsessing over it anyways?</p>
         <p>Have you found yourself adopting diet after diet, searching for a sense of fulfillment?</p>
         <p>I get it. I spent years of my life scrambling everywhere for the answers I was looking for. I listened to podcasts, hired gurus, read books, I moved states, I bought a puppy and I continued to try just about everything I could think of.
           <p>While all of these mechanisms are wonderful, they still can't even scrape the surface of what <em>real</em> healing can provide for you.</p>
           <p>You see, I used to be a fitness competitor who was obsessed with <strong>clean eating, counting macros, and working out twice a day</strong>. I <em>know</em> what it's like to find yourself in the throes of orthorexia, where your body and food becomes the number one priority in your life.</p>
           <img style= "height: 450px; width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0 auto; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;" src="http://maddymoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_9195.jpg"/>
           <p>After practicing self-care rituals day after day, I realized something else was <strong>missing</strong> from my life. Something <strong>bigger</strong> than anything I had been doing.</p>
           <p>Everyone kept telling me to <em>search</em> within to find all of the answers. But I found the <em>more</em> I searched within, the <em>less</em> I found what I really needed.</p>
      <h2>...until I realized it was <span class="circled">God</span> that was missing from my "healing" process.</h2>
      <img style="height: 450px; width: 300px; display: block; margin: 10px auto 50px auto; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888" src="http://maddymoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/journaling.jpeg">
    </div>
    <div class="centered-block">
      <p><strong>From that day on, I started praying daily that God would change my heart.</strong> I didn't pray that I would change my <em>own</em> heart, because I knew <em>that</em> wasn't going to happen. Only He could do it because only He could fill the empty space in my heart that I was trying to fill with food, perfectionism and my body image.</p>
      <ul class="cross">
        <li>Do you want to ask Christ to provide the kind of healing that ends with you spending more time thinking about things you're passionate about than you do about your next meal?</li>
        <li>Do you want to feast on the bread of life instead of your never-satisfying gluten-free, low calorie, non-GMO, "clean" eating snacks? </li>
        <li>Do you want God to give you the courage you need to delete your calorie counting app and burn up your meal plan for good?</li>
        <li>Are you fed up with obsessing over having the perfect diet and perfect body?</li>
        <li>Do you want to be the "salt of the earth" but can't get past your literal <em>fear</em> of eating salt in your diet?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="top-margin">If you answered yes to any of these, the <em>big</em> question remains. How do we let go of our need to control, and give it over to God? How do we get to a place where food is just food, and it's no longer what we obsess about?</p>

          <p>"Scripture, Food and Healing was such a game-changer for me in my journey and I am so grateful that Maddy offers this course. I came into the course with low self-confidence and I knew I wanted to know and understand exactly who I was in Christ before I went a step further. Scripture, Food and Healing helped me to understand and believe to the core that <strong>I am loved, I am valuable, I am important and God doesn't care what I weigh.</strong> He believes I am beautiful, valuable, important and worthy just as I am right now. Working with Maddy is a true joy. She is kind, warm and helpful. She asks thoughtful questions throughout the course that really helped me get to the root of the issue, process through it and move on to the next step. She is supportive and genuine and she really made me feel comfortable. Thanks to Maddy and Scripture, Food and Healing, <strong>I am well on my way to recovery from binge/restrict eating patterns and I also have a much closer relationship with Christ.</strong>"</p>&nbsp;

          <p>"The missing puzzle piece of healing my relationship with food and how I look at exercise was faith. I've always kept the two in separate "boxes"-I dieted and worked out to make my body look "good" and I would also go to church and pray. I kept the two very far apart from each other, which is why I was never able to allow myself to let go of the rigidity and rules I held around diet/fitness for several years. Maddy's Scripture, Food, and Healing program allowed me to link my faith with my relationship with my body and give all of the anxieties I feel around food and exercise to God. Each day I learned more and more about God's ultimate plan for me and the worth I have in God...<strong>neither of which involve revolving my life around macro-nutrient ratios or spending hours in the gym.</strong>"</p>&nbsp;

          <p>"This has been the most amazing time of recovery and healing for me. I have been all over the spectrum of disordered eating for nearly 25 years. Food has been my coping mechanism; it's been my way of numbing feeling and my means of trying to control my life. I have made steps towards recovery but have sabotaged them, knowing all the time that I can't do it alone. Maddy's course made me feel God's truth and desires for me, and how far I have pushed against Him. I still have a way to go and it's scary to lay all on the Lord but I now know that it's so simple to do. God will only present me with what I can manage, and I've learned these things from Scripture, Food and Healing. Thank you so much Maddy."</p>&nbsp;

          <p>"I was on my road to recovery from orthorexia, exercise addiction and then binge eating when I started Maddy's program, Scripture, Food and Healing. I'm so glad that I finally found a program that centered my recovery on God for healing my relationship with food and body image. It was the perfect way to start my morning every day and has had a huge impact on my life. I highly recommend this program to anyone who is ready to deepen their faith and live a life of full of joy and freedom."</p>&nbsp;

          <p>"Scripture, Food, and Healing has brought me farther then I ever imagined. I've dealt with body image self-esteem, and obsession over food since I was in 5th grade. Never would I have thought that I would become free from the bondage of an eating disorder. We can only do so much by ourselves, then comes God!"</p>&nbsp;

          <p>"After seeing the Scripture, Food and Healing group mentioned by many of the health bloggers I follow, and being tired of the obsessive thought cycle associated with an unhealthy relationship with my body image, I knew that this program was exactly what God was calling me to do. Having overcome an eating disorder twelve years ago, I am now able to keep my body healthy, but needed to make my mind and spirit follow suit. <strong>As a mother of two children, and one of them a baby girl- it is more important than ever for me to be able to emulate a healthy relationship with God and myself- both inside and outside.</strong> This program provided me with an accountability partner that helped me process my thoughts each day in an honest way, fabulous content with some amazing health and wellness experts and spiritual leaders that was intentional and practical. Throughout the process, I found awareness, and ultimately release and healing from decades of incorrect messages and mindsets. I am so thankful for the process, and believe that any woman that has ever looked at herself critically (which unfortunately is most of us) would benefit from this program!"</p>&nbsp;

          <p>"Your program was one of the most soul-filling, nourishing and life-changing six weeks! I was so filled up every morning connecting with God and letting go of all the pressures, rules and regulations to eat perfect, be perfect and look perfect. You are wise beyond your years Maddy and are doing such important work in this world. Your work with Scripture, Food and Healing is a path back home, a reminder of who we truly are and an opening to step into freedom! God bless you!"</p>&nbsp;

          <p>"Prior to my time in the course, I rarely made time for God or for myself. As a busy medical student, I went to church on Sundays, but I wasn’t actively implementing Christ into my daily life or my recovery the way I wanted to. This course reminded me of God’s role in my life and my journey every single day, and for that I am extremely grateful. With the help of this course, <strong>I was able to take off the FitBit that was chained to my wrist for over a year dictating how many compulsive steps I would take each day.</strong> I’m continuing to find comfort in God each day and have been inspired to explore the Bible with She Reads Truth per this course’s recommendation. Thank you, Maddy, for giving me a new perspective on recovery through Christ. I needed it more than you know."</p>&nbsp;

          <div class="answer">Absolutely! I am a body positive, Health at Every Size advocate and I wrote this course in a way that's respectful to each and every body type.

          <div class="answer">I give you many of the same tools, exercises and assignments that I give my 1:1 clients who suffer from disordered eating. I will guide you to more self compassion and body respect so that you may finally find yourself enjoying your food and putting to rest the quest for the perfect diet, once and for all. </div>
          <h3 class="question">Q: What denomination are you?</h3>

          <div class="answer">Receiving content via email means no logins, no caching browsers, no technical difficulties and no frustrating website glitches! Email is the easiest way to receive content every day because it's delivered to you instead of you having to remember to visit the website.

          <h3 class="question">Q: What if I have an eating disorder?</h3>
          <div class="answer">If you have a clinical disorder such an anorexia or bulimia, this program does not substitute medical attention. This program is for obsessive dieters, body-shamers, exercise "addicts" and people who are sick of obsessing over the perfect diet. If you have a severe disorder, you need personalized attention with a doctor or medical professional. This program may be helpful alongside medical care but should not be the sole support.</div>

      <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 65px; line-height: 130%" class="bitter">Do you desire to strengthen your relationship with God <em>and</em> food?</h2>
      <h1 class="bitter centered">Do you wish to heal your heart after years of disordered eating?</h1>
      <p>
        Have you been searching endlessly for ways to finally become a "normal" eater?
      </p>
      <p>I get it. I spent years of my life searching everywhere for the answers I was looking for. I listened to podcasts, hired gurus, read books, I moved states, I bought a puppy and I continued to try just about everything I could think of.
      <p>While all of these mechanisms are wonderful, they still can't even scrape the surface of what <em>real</em> healing can provide for you.</p>
      <p>You see, I used to be a fitness competitor who was obsessed with <strong>clean eating, counting macros, and working out twice a day</strong>. I <em>know</em> what it's like to find yourself in the throes of orthorexia, where your body and food becomes the number one priority in your life.</p>

      <p>After practicing self-care rituals day after day, I realized something else was <strong>missing</strong> from my life. Something <strong>bigger</strong> than anything I had been doing.</p>
      <p>Everyone kept telling me to <em>search</em> within to find all of the answers. But I found the <em>more</em> I searched within, the <em>less</em> I found what I really needed.</p>
      <h1>...until I realized it was God that was missing from my "healing" process.</h2>

        <h1 class="top-margin">"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
        -Matthew 6:25</h1>
        <p><strong>From that day on, I started praying daily that God would change my heart.</strong> I didn't pray that I would change my <em>own</em>heart, because I knew <em>that</em> wasn't going to happen. Only He could do it because only He could fill the empty space in my heart that I was trying to fill with food, perfectionism and my body image.</p>
        <ul class="cross">
          <li>Have you ever asked Christ to provide the kind of healing that ends with you spending more time thinking about your love for life than you do about your next meal?</li>
          <li><p class="top-margin">Have you ever asked God to help you feast on the Bread of Life instead of your gluten-free, low calorie, </li>
          <li><p class="top-margin"> Trust me when I say that only Christ can give you the courage you need to delete your calorie counting app and burn up your meal plan once and for all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="top-margin">But how do we get to this place? How do we get to a place where food is just food, and it's no longer a coping mechanism for stress, fear and rejection?</p>
